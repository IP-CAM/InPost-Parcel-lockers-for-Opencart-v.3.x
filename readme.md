# OpenCart InPost - InPost Parcel lockers
I present to you my proprietary shipping module InPost - Paczkomaty to OpenCarta version 3.0. The module can be used for commercial purposes.

# Support
The OpenCart InPost module has been shared for free, so we ask all of its users with voluntary financial support for the author. Thanks to your donations, I will continue to develop this and other free modules for OpenCart.
